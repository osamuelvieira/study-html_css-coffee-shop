[^note]:This study was based on the [Starbucks template developed in Nicepage](https://nicepage.com/pt/ht/17223/cafe-starbucks-modelo-html). I am not the author of the layout and have no professional relationship with Starbucks. All credits for this layout should be given to the developers and designers responsible for its creation.
